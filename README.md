Vii is a new programming language aiming at fast compile speeds, with easy to write code.

Some of the goals are:
- K.I.S.S - Keep it simple, stupid.
- Huge projects shouldn't take forever to compile.
- Library management should be easy
- Multiple export backends: x64, LLVM, etc
- Easy to debug, no `printf` debugging should be needed
- Simple to contribute, and add features

# Contributing

Write good code if you want to contribute. *PLEASE* avoid managing memory yourself. No one is good at it, just use smart pointers for fuck sake.

If you want to know how things should be written, just look at how some of the code in the repo has been written.
