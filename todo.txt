### 10/10/17 - Something compiled omg

if statements (else, else if)
true / false implementations
meta information on objects to allow for inheritance, tostring, runtime information, etc
proper checking for variable existance when calling functions Ex: print just assumes that the things passed are the correct type
solve all the TODOs
Create LLVM backend
Create standard lib (This should somehow be written in the lang)
Make it actually run g++ or something to make things compile
Implement array type
Implement spread (...string) for types
Imports (Should work on standard lib things too!)
