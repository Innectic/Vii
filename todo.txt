MASSIVE COMPILER BUG: When variables are redeclared, there not recreated AND reassigned, just reassigned.
                      This causes variables to only have the value of their "final form" within the Vii code.



if statements (else, else if)
true / false implementations
meta information on objects to allow for inheritance, tostring, runtime information, etc
proper checking for variable existance when calling functions Ex: print just assumes that the things passed are the correct type
solve all the TODOs
Create LLVM backend
Implement array type
Implement spread (...string) for types
Imports (Should work on standard lib things too!)
Implement structs
